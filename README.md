# Pets4Ever 

Link: https://pets4ever.vercel.app/

This project was born due to the need of improve my skills as Web Developer.

The first version was called Catgram, but at the time I didn't had the proper skills,
so I finished the project with many bugs, due to the deadline.

In this time, wiht Pets4Ever, I'm using more TypeScript to assure the code quality,
and changed the Backend language to Java, with Spring Boot framework.
